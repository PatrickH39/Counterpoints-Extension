## International Space Station (ISS)

The International Space Station, otherwise known as the ISS, resides in low Earth orbit and involves five different space agencies:
- NASA (United States)
- CSA (Canada)
-	ESA (Europe)
-	Roscosmos (Russia)
- JAXA (Japan)

The project for the ISS started on January 25, 1986, and the first segment was sent on November 20, 1998. After two years, astronaut Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, inhabited the station on November 2, 2000; being the first group of people to be on the ISS.

### Canadarm

Although Canada made significant contributions to space technology like the Canadarm, the United States operated it and it was only used for space shuttles until the ISS was built. 

The original Canadarm was used on space shuttles and were controlled by astronauts onboard. It was operated by the United States and compared to Canadarm2, it did not have haptic feedback or a collision system and was limited to a 160-degree elbow rotation. There were two cameras that provided vision to the cabin, and it was 15 metres long. 

When Canadarm2 was built for the ISS, it was to stay permanently. Canadarm2 was sent to the ISS on April 19, 2001 and was a big step in the evolution of space technology. Both astronauts on the ISS and people down at ground control had access to the arm and there was also a collision system with haptic feedback. Unlike the first arm that was built, Canadarm2 was controlled by Canada and the United States, and the arm has been on the ISS for
