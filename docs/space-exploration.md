# Space Exploration

## International Space Station (ISS)

The International Space Station, otherwise known as the ISS, resides in low Earth orbit and involves five different space agencies:
- NASA (United States)
- CSA (Canada)
-	ESA (Europe)
-	Roscosmos (Russia)
- JAXA (Japan)

The project for the ISS started on January 25, 1986, and the first segment was sent on November 20, 1998. After two years, astronaut Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, inhabited the station on November 2, 2000; being the first group of people to be on the ISS.

### Robotics on the ISS
:::caution

Canadarm, Canadarm2, and Canadarm3 respectively are successors of one another. They are not the same.

Although Canada made significant contributions to space technology, for example the Canadarm. The United States was its main operator, and it was only solely for space shuttles until the ISS was built. 

Compared to Canadarm2, it did not have haptic feedback or a collision system and was limited to a 160-degree elbow rotation. There were two cameras which provided vision for the cabin and the arm was 15 metres in length. It was retired as of July 2011, and its successor, Canadarm2 now resides in the ISS.

Canadarm2 was sent to the ISS on April 19, 2001 and was a big step in the evolution of space technology. Both astronauts on the ISS and people down at ground control had access to the arm and there was also a collision system with haptic feedback. Unlike the first arm, Canadarm2 was controlled by both Canada and the United States. Currently in development is Canadarm3–which will be a fully autonomous, artificial intelligence powered robot at the Lunar Gateway, but to this day, the most sophisticated space robot ever built, is Dextre.

Dextre, short for the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), has been serving the ISS since 2008. It performs maintenance work such as charging batteries or replacing cameras. The robot was launched aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor. Five days later, NASA astronauts Richard Linnehan and Mike Foreman installed it. The robot has the ability to repair itself, and reduces the risks associated to space walks for astronauts.

Since 2013, Dextre and Canadarm2 have been printed on the $5 polymer banknotes, highlighting the achievements that Canada have made in space exploration. The materials for Canada’s space projects are supplied by over 500 organizations across Canada, including **MDA** which assembled, built, and delivered a large portion of the parts to the ISS.

## The Challenger Accident

The Space Shuttle, _Challenger_ was a partially reusable spacecraft operated by the United States equipped with 5 Canadarms. It would undergo 9 missions before it would explode into pieces, killing all 7 crew members onboard. Challenger was planned to study Halley’s Comet and to deploy a communications satellite, but it broke apart after 73 seconds of launch.

The cause of its crash was because of two O-ring seals in the space shuttle’s solid rocket booster (SRC). Pressurized gas burnt through the walls of the external fuel tank, causing a structural failure which led to an explosion. This accident was fatal and caused a 32-month hiatus in the Space Shuttle program. The last words from Michael J. Smith would be the following:
