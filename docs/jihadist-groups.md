# Jihadist Groups

## ISIS, ISIL, and IS-KP

The Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) more commonly known as The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was formed in 1999 and pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda. They gained traction in 2014 when they successfully overthrew the Iraqi government. US stationed troops were driven out and the key city of Mosul was under ISIS occupation. ISIS was able to gather such a large following from online propaganda such as YouTube and using religion to justify their actions. Due to many of ISIS’s violent actions the main demographic are young men with radical views towards the west. This includes French, American, British, and citizens who live in primarily western countries who changed their ideologies. Citizens in Iraq, Syria, and Khorasan (ISIS-K) either flee to the west as refugees, or pledge allegiance to ISIS for food, shelter, and safety. 
The Paris attack in November 2015 was what solidified ISIS as a threat to the west. 3 suicide bombers attacked outside of the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. Gunmen also attacked crowded cafes and restaurants in Paris and a venue consisting of 1,500 people at Bataclan theatre. 130 people were killed along with 416 being wounded and none of the terrorists survived. ISIS’s motive behind the attack was retaliation for the French airstrikes in Syria and Iraq. France then retaliated with the largest bombing campaign against Iraq- Opération Chammal. 

### Martin Rouleau Couture Incident

October 24, 2014 In Montreal, Quebec, Martin Rouleau Couture hit 2 soldiers who were a part of the armed forces. One soldier was killed and the other was left heavily injured. Couture was then shot by the municipal police and died in the hospital the morning after. Prior to this, Martin Rouleau Couture was identified as a potential important terrorist threat. He was arrested in 2013 but there was not enough evidence to keep him in custody. Along with this, he converted to Islam as well. Couture was not heavily monitored even though there were many signs of him being radicalized. 

### Hamid Karzai International Airport Attack in Kabul Afghanistan

The Hamid Karzai International Airport terrorist attack is the most recent act of terrorism by ISIS. The airport was especially crowded at the time since it was the only way out of Afghanistan after the Taliban took control. Us military personnel was stationed in Afghanistan before the attack. The Pentagon sent a warning to the US congress to remove troops stationed in Afghanistan as it would only provoke an attack. Then, on August 26, 2021 a suicide bomber theorized to be part of IS-KP detonated an explosive belt in the crowd. IS-KP gunmen fired into the crowd with the attack claiming the lives of 169 afghan civilians, 13 US military personnel, and 28 Taliban fighters. After the attack, the Taliban stated that they would capture the IS-KP leader Shahab al Muhajir. The IS-KP stands in the way of a full militarized control of Afghanistan by the Taliban.

## Al Qaeda & 9/11

Al Qaeda was the terrorist group behind the 911 attacks on September 11, 2001. Formed in 1988 and defeated by the US in 2014, Al Qaeda was a short-lived threat. However, any groups carry similar Jihadist ideologies such as ISIS and the Taliban. ISIS had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda in 1999
