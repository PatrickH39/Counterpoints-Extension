# The Persian Gulf War

## Tension Between Countries

A pre-existing tension between Iraq and Kuwait was what caused the Persian Gulf War. Iraq rightfully believed that Kuwait was still a part of Iraq after they had declared independence on June 19, 1961. Iraq also believed that Kuwait was illegally stealing oil from reserves located in Iraq. Most of the worldâ€™s oil comes from the middle east meaning Iraq could restrict the world oil supply at any moment. Growing tensions were also present between Iraq and the US. Iraq was already being suspected of human rights abuse and was a former soviet nation. 

## Collapse and Recovery of Kuwait

On August 2, 1990, Iraq had annexed Kuwait. Kuwait did not stand a chance against the overwhelming military of Iraq. Many retreated to Saudi Arabia. The UN immediately responded with economic sanctions against Iraq. A coalition of 35 members of the United Nations was formed to liberate Kuwait. The leading country of the coalition was the United States with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Kuwait being leading contributors. However, the plan to liberate Kuwait was delayed as Iraq was suspected to have chemical and biological weapons. Then on October 30, 1990, the war that the United States led against Iraq heavily benefitted the west. The United States had many reasons to declare war against Iraq. Much of its economy comes from oil and the fact that Iraq was a former ally of the Soviet Union allowed the US to increase its influence as a powerful capitalist country. The occupation by Iraq only lasted 7 months with the group effort by the coalition liberating Kuwait. The UN enforced economic sanctions in exchange for a cease-fire and Iraq was forced to pay war reparations. 

## Canada Back in the Air

The Persian Gulf war was the first time Canadians participated in battle since the Korean war in 1953. 4000 Canadians served as a part of a coalition of 45 countries. Many countries only participated by sending supplies and not actively fighting. Canada also manufactured CF-18 fighters along with sending soldiers. In the battle of the gulf the Canadian Naval Task Group controlled water with the HMCS Terra Nova and HMCS Athabaskan destroyers. Also, Canada fulfilled its role as a peacekeeper. In February 1991, a Canadian Field Hospital with 530 personnel operating was set up in Qaysumah, Saudi Arabia. They cared for the coalition and the Iraq soldiers.
