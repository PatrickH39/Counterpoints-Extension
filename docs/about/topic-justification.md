# Topic Justification

The topics listed below are ranked by importance by its respective positions.

## Human Genome Project

On January 21, 2020, the first ever coronavirus was recorded. As of December 6, 2021, there were a total of 265.8 million cases and 5.2 million COVID-19 related deaths. With the research of the human genome a vaccine was quickly developed and reduced the amount of potential COVID-19 cases by millions. 

## Jihadist Groups

ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban are known names in the West. Past threats such as 9/11 and the Paris terrorist attack in 2014 are what causes people to fear these names. The threat is still ongoing, but it should not be generalized to all Muslim and Islamic peoples. The difference should be known between a stigma against Jihadist groups and one against the practice of a culture. On January 27, 2017, the 45th President Donald J. Trump agreed to the passing of Executive Order 13769. It was to protect the United States from foreign terrorist entry. Many of the countries banned were those of a majority Muslim population. This affected millions of people who travel to the US for work, family, and immigration. The threat of Jihadist groups from these countries do exist, but the generalization that was made against Muslim people was unjust. 

## Space Exploration

Canada’s participation in space exploration programs have been those of a supportive role. Responsible for the construction of Canadarm, Canadarm2, and Dextre, Canada has been contributing to the ISS since 1986. The arms are used for space repairs and construction on shuttles, machinery, and the ISS. Canada has achieved something greater which is the most advanced space robot built-Dextre. It currently operates on the ISS and performs maintenance and safety checks. Currently, Canada is working on Canadarm 3 which will be fully autonomous and a breakthrough in space development. Without Canada’s developments in space exploration, other countries would not be able to progress as far as they have. 

## Kosovo War

The Kosovo war showed the military might and control NATO has. The bombing campaign on Yugoslavia was criticized by the UN for the unnecessary killing of citizens. However, the war was won by this however as the Military Technical Treaty was signed on June 9, 1999 requiring all Serbian forces to withdraw from Kosovo. Canada had to participate in this war as a peacekeeper. The CAF was involved for the first time since the Korean War. Canada as well invested $750,000 in CIDA which gave humanitarian aid to Kosovo.  


## Persian Gulf War

Prior to the war there were growing conflicts between the two countries. Human rights, Oil control, and Iraq being a former soviet state were all reasons for war to be waged against Iraq.
