# The Kosovo War

## Introduction

The Kosovo War was an armed conflict that began on February 28th, 1998 and ended on June 11th, 1999. Serbian nationalism caused many civilians to seek refuge elsewhere. The conflict was resolved with the intervention of NATO. Law, order, and stability were restored, but at a heavy cost.

## A Divided Country

Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, rejected Kosovar Albanians by implementing Serbian nationalist policies. Around 1.2 million to 1.45 million Kosovo Albanians were persecuted, which made up around 90% of Kosovo’s entire population. Ibrahim Rugova established the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in the early 1990s to rebel against the Serbian persecution of Kosovar Albanians. After numerous raids on Serbian government property and army posts, the KLA attacked Yugoslav authorities. This resulted in Serb forces pursuing KLA supporters and political opponents in a campaign of retribution. An approximated 1500 to 2000 civilians and KLA combatants died in the campaign. The war soon caught NATO's attention, resulting in the NATO aerial bombing on Yugoslavia, forcing Yugoslav forces to withdraw from Kosovo. The UN Security Council criticized the bombing because more than 488 Yugoslav civilians and Kosovar refugees were killed in the bombing. 

## Operation Echo

Operation Echo was the codename for the Canadian Armed Force’s (CAF) air activities in the Kosovo War. To support the Stabilization Force (SFOR) and Kosovo Force (KFOR), Canada sent 6 CF-18 Hornet fighter aircraft and 125 air personnel to an airbase in Aviano, Italy in preparation for the 79-day air campaign over the Balkans. The CAF flew 684 sorties and dropped nearly 250 tons of gravity and guided bombs in 224 missions. Although Operation Echo comprised less than 2% of the total Allied aircraft involved in the air campaign, they flew in 10% of all the bombing missions. Despite flying for the first time since the Korean War, Canada reigned victorious with only five air personnel casualties. 

## Operation Kinetic

After the NATO air campaigns, NATO’s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps requested the Canadian government to send troops on a peacekeeping mission in Macedonia. A month later, 800 Canadian troops arrived in Macedonia and joined the 4th Armoured Brigade under the codename Operation Kinetic. As agreed in the Military Technical Treaty, the Serb security forces withdrew from Kosovo as the KFOR entered the country. The success of the Serb withdrawal established KFOR in Kosovo. The deployed troops enforced the cease-fire, provided civilians with security, helped the lost get home safely, assisted international and non-governmental organizations, and carried out humanitarian aid operations with the $750,000 in Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) funding. After the initial deployment, 500 more troops were sent to the Canadian contingent, totaling 1400 personnel. The soldiers from the 1st battalion and Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light infantry formed a battle infantry group. The rotation of troops took place twice, performing similar duties as the group prior. All military personnel were withdrawn from Kosovo by the end of June 2000.

## The Outcome

The Military Technical Agreement (also known as the Kumanovo Treaty) was signed on June 9, 1999 in Kumanovo, Macedonia. The agreement concluded the Kosovo War and established relations between Yugoslavia and KFOR. Over 13,500 people were killed or went missing during the conflict. 200,000 Serbs, Romani, and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo after the war. Those who remained were subject to abuse.  The KLA disbanded after the war.
